## Overview

The notebook includes various sections:
1. **Data Loading and Visualization**: Load the MNIST dataset and visualize the digits.
2. **Model Building**: Step-by-step building of a deeper CNN model.
3. **Training**: Process of fitting the model on the training data.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model with accuracy and other metrics on the test dataset.

## Prerequisites
To run this notebook, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Keras
You can install the required packages using `pip`:
